<h2 class="mt-0">What is ScriptorCode?</h2>

                    <span class="pink">ScriptorCode</span> is an open-source website similar to Pastebin where you can store any piece of code,
                    and generate links for easy sharing<br /><br />

                    However, what makes ScriptorCode special is that it works with <span class="pink">no database</span>, and
                    <span class="pink">no back-end code</span>.<br />
                    Instead, the data is compressed and <span class="pink">stored entirely in the link</span> that you share, nowhere else!

                    <h3>Because of this design:</h3>
                    🗑️ Your data <span class="pink">cannot be deleted</span> from ScriptorCode<br />
                    🔞 Your data <span class="pink">cannot be censored</span><br />
                    👁️ The server hosting ScriptorCode (or any clone of it) <span class="pink">cannot read or access</span> your data<br />
                    ⏳ Your data will be accessible <span class="pink">forever</span> (as long as you have the link)<br />
                    🔀 You can access your data on <span class="pink">every ScriptorCode clone</span>, including
                    <a href="https://github.com/shadowforce78/ScriptorCode" rel="noopener" target="_blank"
                        >your own</a
                    ><br />
                    🔍 Google <span class="pink">will not index</span> your data, even if your link is public<br />
                    <br />
